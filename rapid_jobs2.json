We also offer competitive compensation, benefits, and profession development opportunities. Please refer to our Benefits section for additional details.\n\nFlex Time\n\nNorthstrat does not mandate specific working hours. Although project requirements may dictate schedules, a Northstrat employee is only required to work an average of 8 hours per weekday over the course of a month. For example: John worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend. John\u2019s IBA was not debited for time off because flex time allowed him to carry over those 4 hours from June 1st.\n\nIndividual Benefits Account (IBA)\n\nTo attract and retain the highest quality staff, Northstrat provides a unique and versatile benefits package, the Individual Benefit Account (IBA), which places the power of choice in the hands of our greatest asset \u2013 the employee.\n\nThe purpose of the IBA is to provide attractive benefits to all full-time employees of Northstrat on a flexible basis that enables each covered employee to select a package that best suits his or her needs. Whether those needs are paid time off, medical expenses, prescription drug expenses, cash disbursement, or a combination of any of these, the IBA provides flexibility to help you meet your specific goals. The IBA can be used for such things as:\n\u2022 Medical and Vision Insurance through United Health Care; Dental insurance through Delta Dental\n\u2022 100% Medical Reimbursement\n\u2022 Time Off with Pay\n\u2022 Profit Sharing Plan\n\u2022 401k\n\u2022 Educational Benefits\n\u2022 Additional Income\n\nIBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee\u2019s monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employee\u2019s salary.\n\nProfit Sharing Plan (PSP)\n\nThe PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds quarterly on the employee\u2019s behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employee\u2019s compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP.\n\nStock Options\n\nBecause Northstrat is an employee-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company.\n\nLifelong Learning\n\nOur culture promotes and nurtures a growth environment. We hire and scale rapidly to meet the needs of our partner customers. Through the use of company provided online learning opportunities, periodic company sponsored training events, and the ability to use IBA funds for reimbursement of work-related education expenses you will have the opportunity to continually grow your skills and abilities.\n\nBring Your True Self\n\nWe embrace diversity and encourage inclusion. We support employee led interest groups and challenge our employees to support others and be their best self. We are so true to our beliefs that we offer employee referral incentives.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.\n\nWe\u2019re building a team that will research and mitigate extreme risks from future models.\n\nThis team will intensively red-team models to test the most significant risks they might be capable of in the area of Cybersecurity. We believe that clear demonstrations can significantly advance technical research and mitigations, as well as identify effective policy interventions to promote and incentivize safety.\n\nAs part of this team, you will lead research to baseline current models and test whether future frontier capabilities could cause significant harm. Day-to-day, you may decide you need to finetune a model to see whether it becomes superhuman in an eval you\u2019ve designed; whiteboard a threat model with a national security expert; test a new training procedure or how a model uses a tool; or brief government, labs, and other research teams. Our goal is to see the frontier before we get there.\n\nWe\u2019re currently hiring for our Cyber workstream (as outlined in our Responsible Scaling Policy). By nature, this team will be an unusual combination of backgrounds.

You have ideas about how AI and ML evaluations can be more realistic. You\u2019ve thought hard about all the ways to improve model performance on a given benchmark.\n\nDo not rule yourself out if you do not fit one of those categories - it\u2019s plausible the people we\u2019re looking for do not fit any of the above!
